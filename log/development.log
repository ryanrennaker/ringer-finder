That tradition of innovation and quality continues today. From a brand that is synonymous with quality, comfort and style, the Serta Santa Cruz Collection Sofa offers many attractive features that you're going to love. Starting with its Tool-free EZ assembly, which is the most convenient and stress free on the market today. This product goes from box to built in mere minutes. But that's just the beginning, this sofa is generous and comfortable as well. In fact, you might find it a great place for a nap. Here's why: Starting from the ground up, you have a solid stance on real wood legs. Next, the lower foundation is constructed with hardwood materials and the tried and true method of mechanically fastened and glued hardwood plywood corner blocks that reinforce the frame and sturdiness, along with track style arms with corrugated reinforced outer-sides. Attached to that are heavy-duty 8 gauge anti-sag sinuous springs secured and joined with a double row of tie wire. This forms a comfortable, supportive and lasting seating structure. Resting upon this are seat cushions with rows of individually pocketed comfort coils surrounded by high density seating foam, and premium quality poly-fibers on top. This cushion system forms the basis of our sit down, and sink in feel. Behind that you have the upper structure which consists of more hardwood material and a matrix of non-woven strapping that form a dense and sturdy back structure. In front of that are the pillowed back cushions. These consist of an inner poly-fiber core contained in a non-woven cover to help maintain shape and density. Wrap the whole thing in a lush and luxurious 100-Percent polyester Platinum Fabric and you have a gorgeous piece for any living space. 1 year limited warranty. Product assembly is required.

That tradition of innovation and quality continues today. From a brand that is synonymous with quality, comfort and style, the Serta Santa Cruz Collection Sofa offers many attractive features that you're going to love. Starting with its Tool-free EZ assembly, which is the most convenient and stress free on the market today. This product goes from box to built in mere minutes. But that's just the beginning, this sofa is generous and comfortable as well. In fact, you might find it a great place for a nap. Here's why: Starting from the ground up, you have a solid stance on real wood legs. Next, the lower foundation is constructed with hardwood materials and the tried and true method of mechanically fastened and glued hardwood plywood corner blocks that reinforce the frame and sturdiness, along with track style arms with corrugated reinforced outer-sides. Attached to that are heavy-duty 8 gauge anti-sag sinuous springs secured and joined with a double row of tie wire. This forms a comfortable, supportive and lasting seating structure. Resting upon this are seat cushions with rows of individually pocketed comfort coils surrounded by high density seating foam, and premium quality poly-fibers on top. This cushion system forms the basis of our sit down, and sink in feel. Behind that you have the upper structure which consists of more hardwood material and a matrix of non-woven strapping that form a dense and sturdy back structure. In front of that are the pillowed back cushions. These consist of an inner poly-fiber core contained in a non-woven cover to help maintain shape and density. Wrap the whole thing in a lush and luxurious 100-Percent polyester Platinum Fabric and you have a gorgeous piece for any living space. 1 year limited warranty. Product assembly is required.

The stakes: $1 million in a winner-takes-all competition. The objective: to see the most cities in North America - in just 7 days. Ticket to Ride is a cross-country train adventure game. Players collect train cards that enable them to claim railway routes connecting cities throughout North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who can fulfill their Destination Tickets by connecting two distant cities, and to the player who builds the longest continuous railway. For 2 to 5 players ages 8 and older. Playing time: 30-60 minutes.

That tradition of innovation and quality continues today. From a brand that is synonymous with quality, comfort and style, the Serta Santa Cruz Collection Sofa offers many attractive features that you're going to love. Starting with its Tool-free EZ assembly, which is the most convenient and stress free on the market today. This product goes from box to built in mere minutes. But that's just the beginning, this sofa is generous and comfortable as well. In fact, you might find it a great place for a nap. Here's why: Starting from the ground up, you have a solid stance on real wood legs. Next, the lower foundation is constructed with hardwood materials and the tried and true method of mechanically fastened and glued hardwood plywood corner blocks that reinforce the frame and sturdiness, along with track style arms with corrugated reinforced outer-sides. Attached to that are heavy-duty 8 gauge anti-sag sinuous springs secured and joined with a double row of tie wire. This forms a comfortable, supportive and lasting seating structure. Resting upon this are seat cushions with rows of individually pocketed comfort coils surrounded by high density seating foam, and premium quality poly-fibers on top. This cushion system forms the basis of our sit down, and sink in feel. Behind that you have the upper structure which consists of more hardwood material and a matrix of non-woven strapping that form a dense and sturdy back structure. In front of that are the pillowed back cushions. These consist of an inner poly-fiber core contained in a non-woven cover to help maintain shape and density. Wrap the whole thing in a lush and luxurious 100-Percent polyester Platinum Fabric and you have a gorgeous piece for any living space. 1 year limited warranty. Product assembly is required. Designed in the USA. Manufacturer style number is CR-43534 ."], ["image_url", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91G2Gn8AihL._SL1500_.jpg"], ["name", "Sofa"], ["price", 370], ["updated_at", Fri, 28 Feb 2014 03:35:51 UTC +00:00]]
